# Contributing to Senter Hantu

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! This Flutter flashlight app is currently facing critical issues and **needs help from experienced developers**.

## üö® Current Project Status

**CRITICAL ISSUE**: The core flashlight functionality is not working. This project needs contributors with expertise in:

- Android hardware API development
- Flutter platform channels
- Camera/torch access on Android
- Device-specific compatibility issues

## üîß Priority Issues Needing Help

### 1. **Flashlight Control Failure** (CRITICAL)
- **Problem**: `torch_light` package fails on Oppo A74 4G
- **Error**: "Gagal mengontrol flashlight" 
- **Need**: Alternative implementation or device-specific workarounds

### 2. **Memory Management Issues** (HIGH)
- **Problem**: Out of memory during `flutter run`
- **Workaround**: Manual APK build required
- **Need**: Build process optimization

### 3. **Brightness Control** (MEDIUM)
- **Problem**: PWM simulation doesn't provide effective dimming
- **Current**: Timer-based on/off cycling
- **Need**: Better approach for brightness control

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Contribute

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK 3.9.0+
- Android development experience
- Physical Android device for testing
- Understanding of hardware API limitations

### Setup Development Environment
```bash
git clone [your-repo-url]
cd senter_hantu
flutter pub get

# Note: flutter run may fail with out of memory
# Use this workflow instead:
flutter clean
flutter build apk --debug
adb install build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk
```

### Testing Process
1. **Install APK** on your Android device
2. **Test flashlight button** - currently shows error
3. **Document device info**: Brand, model, Android version
4. **Try alternative approaches** in code
5. **Report results** with detailed logs

## üß™ Current Test Results

| Device | Brand | Model | Android | Status | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|---------|--------|-------|
| CPH2219 | Oppo | A74 4G | Unknown | ‚ùå Failed | torch_light package not working |

**WE NEED MORE DEVICE TESTING DATA!**

## üéØ Areas Needing Immediate Help

### 1. Alternative Flashlight Libraries
Research and test alternatives to `torch_light`:
- `flashlight` package
- `camera` package with flash control
- Native Android implementations

### 2. Platform Channels Implementation
Create native Android module:
```kotlin
// Example approach needed
class FlashlightPlugin {
    private fun enableFlashlight(): Boolean {
        // Direct Android Camera2 API access
        // Handle device-specific implementations
    }
}
```

### 3. Device Compatibility Matrix
Build comprehensive device testing:
- Samsung devices
- Xiaomi devices  
- OnePlus devices
- Oppo devices (currently failing)
- Vivo devices
- Google Pixel devices
